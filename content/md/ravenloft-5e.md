# Ravenloft 5e

---

## I. Character Creation

### A. Mechanics-Related

* You may only pick PHB races.
* Feats are permitted.
* Xanathar's Guide to Everything is kosher.
* Ask for permission before using a D&D insider article for your character.
* We are using pointbuy to determine stats.
* We are starting at level 4
* I'm not expecting this campaign to reach past level 6.

### B. RP Related

* No evil alignments.
* Use Forgotten Realms deities.
* Assume your from J's Campaign world.
* Knowing and intentionally causing grevious harm (physical, mental, or finacial) to innocent bystandards for personal benefits or amusement cause a Power Check (See section **III**). Don't go out of your way to be a dick.

### C. Pre-established lore

You are not a native of this plane, you are a part of an already established adventuring party with the rest of your fine fellows, assume you are already familar and comfortable with one another. Your travelling caravan has been engulfed in a thick mist as you leave town despite the day previously being very sunny, as you travel for 20 minutes or so you find yourselves on a completely different path in a strange, foreign and hostile land. This is where our adventure begins.

## II. Spells and Mechanics

### A. Spells

* *Necromancy* spells cast as one spell level higher without spending a higher level spell slot, but cause a powers check to occur. If you have good intentions or reason to use it, then you get advantage on this check. Creating Undead is exempt from good intention/reason clause. While Necromancy is not inheritly evil, the Dark Powers find it a very easy power to corrupt. 

* *Illusion* spells: Spells that relate to shadows or shadowcraft are cast a level higher, but you must make your own Spell Save DC or the shadows will potentially come to life, hostile to all beings.

* *Conjuration* spells: Spells related to creature summoning function differently, creatures called to your aid from inside of Ravenloft are still subject to their Domain Lords Control (if appliciable) which overrides your own. Spells that summon extraplanar creatures will trap that creature inside of Ravenloft, and they must also find their own way out. Please keep in mind that you're control does not extend past the initial summoning time.

* *Enchantment* spells: Enchantment spells can be overriden by the Domain Lord if related to their sphere of influence, Domain lords get advantage on avoiding the effects of enchantments.

* *Divination* spells: Divination suffer some issues, any remote viewing spells creates a translucent but physical eye to observe the area, you cannot determine alignments on the good/evil axis, and viewing of areas outside of ravenloft will fail (with few incredible exceptions). Gaze attacks can go through divination viewings. Sentient Undead foes can project fake thoughts to you on a successful (private) spell DC save (added to all thought reading spells on undead).

* Spells in general: that challenge a Domain lord's control of their land will always fail. 

### B. Mechanics

* *Death*: your character automatically ressurect if they die the next day, roll for a Gift from the Dark Powers (see section **III**).

## 3. Power Checks

### A. Initial Roll

Roll a 1d100 without modifier, on a failed roll, you gain a 'gift' from the Dark Powers.

The failure roll is determined by the action that caused the power Roll, these are listed below.

```
Cause                     | Failure DC
--------------------------|----------------------------
Necromancy                | Equal to Spell Slot Spent (1 for cantrip)
Theft from Needy          | 3
Blasphamy                 | 3
Betrayal (Minor)          | 5
Passion Killing           | 5
Blasphamy (Religious PCs) | 10
Betrayal (Major)          | 10
Premeditated Murder       | 10
Horrific Act              | 15
```

If your action would cause multiple Dark Power rolls, instead only roll only once and add the DCs together.
